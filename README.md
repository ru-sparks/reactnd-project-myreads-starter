# MyReads Project

This is the the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
It is a management application for avid readers.  It allows the assignment of a current shelf
of books to three categories
1) Currently Reading
2) Want to Read
3) Read

It also allows for new book search and assignment.
## TL;DR

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
